* visualize org-brain relationships using EAF


** Requirements
- org-brain
- EAF/PyQt (some programs in EAF don't run for me, but that doesn't seem to be a problem)
- graph-tool (unlike graphviz, it allows to start layout calculations from predefined coordinates, which results in relatively little node re-arrangement)
- some other python libs

** Installation:
- create folder emacs-application-framework/app/obr-viz, copy/symlink buffer.py there
- load the obr-viz.el functions (it's not really a package yet)

** Usage:
- in org-brain, pin/unpin nodes whose links are of interest
- run (=M-x eaf-obr-test=) to start the python process (*does something have to be selected?*)
  - edges of children of pins are rendered as well,
  - hierarchical relationships are rendered the parent starts with "cls_" (class)
- update the links obr-viz (bound to (=G=)) and generate a new layout with obr-viz-redraw (bound to (=R=))


** Limitations/Particularities:
- currently only annotated edges are visualized; this allows to use directed edges by default
- updates have to be manually triggered (I haven't figured out hooks yet)
- selection through pins seems a bit wonky, may be switched to categories/query language
- if the network does not constitute a component, the individual components are pushed strongly apart by the layout algorithm

*Disclaimer*: This is the first time I'm trying to develop something like an application, as well as using Elisp and GUIs; this should be visible in the code quality.


** Example: Twin Peaks character relations based on some episodes of S1
